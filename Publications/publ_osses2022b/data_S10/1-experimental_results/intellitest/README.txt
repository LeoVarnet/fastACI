This participant conduced three lists on 24/03:
	2 x steady condition
	1 x mod8

This participant conducted two new lists on 31/03 (by LV, grande cabine), but these results were not pushed to Git:
	1 x mod8
	1 x steady

This participant conducted three lists on 11/4 (AO thought wasn't aware of the results on 31/03), but of course there are two lists that are repeated with respect to 31/03:
	2 x mod8
	1 x steady

Solution:
	The results were merged on 11/04 but I am fixing now (AO on 12/04) the order of the tests. From the three intellitest sessions 'steady' was tested four times (list number 4 is repeated) and 'mod8' was tested four times (list 4 is repeated). I will store all results in cronological order, but only the first three runs will be used in the main experiments. This means that the last run of 'steady' and the last run of 'mod8' collected on 11/04 will not be used.
