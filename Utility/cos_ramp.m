function ramp = cos_ramp(sig_len_samples, fs, attack, release)
% function ramp = cos_ramp(sig_len, fs, attack, release)
%
% 1. Description:
%       Generates cosine ramp with raising/falling ramp at the begninning/end 
%       (ramps have similar lengths)
%  
%   INPUTS:
%       fs     :  Sampling frequency 
%       sig_len:  Length of signal (in samples)
%       attack :  Attack time of raising envelope (in ms)
%       release:  Release time of falling envelope (optional)
%
%   OUTPUT:
%       ramp:     Resulting envelope 
% 
% 2. Stand-alone example:
%       cos_ramp;
